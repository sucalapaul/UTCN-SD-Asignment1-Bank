ASSIGNMENT A1
====================================================================
1.  Objective
The objective of this assignment is to allow students to become familiar with architectural patterns.

2.	Application Description
Use Swing/C# API to design and implement an application for the front desk employees of a bank. The application should have two types of users (a regular user represented by the front desk employee and an administrator user) which have to provide a username and a password in order to use the application.
The regular user can perform the following operations:
-	Add/update/view client information (name, identity card number, personal numerical code, address, etc.).
-	Create/update/delete/view client account (account information: identification number, type, amount of money, date of creation).
-	Transfer money between accounts.
-	Process utilities bills.
The administrator user can perform the following operations:
-	CRUD on employeesâ€™ information.
-	Generate reports for a particular period containing the activities performed by an employee.

3.	Application Constraints
The data will be stored in a database. Use the Layers architectural pattern to organize your application. Use a domain logic pattern (transaction script or domain model) / a data source hybrid pattern (table module, active record) and a data source pure pattern (table data gateway, row data gateway, data mapper) most suitable for the application.

4.	Requirements
-	Create the analysis and design document (see the template).
-	Implement and test the application.

5.	Deliverables
-	Analysis and design document.
-	Implementation source files.
